    <h1>We're sorry, but something went wrong. You are seeing this because you hit a problem MuVi2 didn't expect.</h1>
    <p>In December 2019 the system was updated for Viafree and Viaplay priorities and if you were working on those and you see the message, please contact MuVi2</p>
    <p>Please give as much detail as you can about what you were doing just before you saw this message</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If it's anything else, MuVi2 still wants to know what you were doing, so we can prevent it happening again.</p>
    <p>If the problem persists, contact MuVi2 with as much detail as you can as about what you were doing just befor you saw this message.</p>
